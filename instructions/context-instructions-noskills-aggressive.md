## Semantic Code Search (jbcontext)

You have access to `jbcontext search` for searching the codebase semantically.
It finds code by meaning, not just keywords.

### When to use

`jbcontext search` is a **code-discovery** tool. It applies only when a task requires finding or understanding code whose location you don't already know.

Skip it — go straight to the right tool — when:

- the task names the exact file, class, or symbol (keyword grep is faster);
- the relevant file is already open or identified;
- the task doesn't involve locating code at all — git operations (rebase, merge, commit), running tests or builds, shell/statusline/config setup, or reviewing a diff you already have.

### MANDATORY: Always use jbcontext for code search

When code discovery *is* needed and you do not yet know the right file, subsystem, implementation, or related test, you MUST start with `jbcontext search` before planning, editing, or exact search. This mandate governs *how* you start code discovery, not whether every task needs a search.

### Usage

```bash
jbcontext search "<detailed and descriptive query>"
jbcontext search -p <path> "<query>"  # <path> must be relative to the project root
```

### Query Tips

- Be descriptive: "Where is a function that validates user email addresses" > "email"
- Include context: "Find error handling middleware for HTTP requests with logging"
- Specify what you're looking for: "React component that renders a modal dialog"
- Use one focused natural-language query per search.
- Do NOT start with grep, ripgrep, or find while the search problem is still semantic or exploratory.
- Inspect the first relevant file or directory before issuing another broad semantic search.
- Use another broad `jbcontext search` only if the local path stops being productive.
- Once you know the relevant file, symbol, or directory, switch to direct file reads or exact search for local inspection.
- If you search again after finding a relevant area, narrow with `-p <path>`.

### Examples

```bash
# Find authentication-related code
jbcontext search "user authentication login flow"

# Narrow to specific directory
jbcontext search -p src/auth "JWT token validation"

# Find callers of a function
jbcontext search "calls to handleRequest to understand impact"

# Find related tests
jbcontext search -p test "tests for authentication middleware"
```

Use `jbcontext search` first for discovery, inspect the first good hit, then move to exact/local inspection once the target area is known.
